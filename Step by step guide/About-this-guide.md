In today's fast-paced IT sector, practical experience is critical to learning DevOps.  This project has been carefully curated to provide hands-on experience with real-time DevOps implementation, utilizing a popular E-Commerce demo project open-sourced by OpenTelemetry.  This project is widely regarded as one of the most effective real-world applications for learning DevOps, and I feel it provides the most practical insights.

To make learning even more immersive, this project employs a multi-microservice design, with each microservice written in a different programming language.  This will help you understand and address real-world difficulties that arise while dealing with various tech stacks in a production environment.

What You Will Learn:
✅ Cloud Infrastructure Setup – Learn how to configure and deploy a cloud environment for DevOps implementation.
✅ Understanding the Project & SDLC – Gain in-depth knowledge of software development lifecycles in microservices-based architectures.
✅ Containerization with Docker – Learn how to package and manage applications efficiently using Docker.
✅ Docker Compose Setup – Manage multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
✅ Kubernetes for Orchestration – Deploy and manage containers at scale using Kubernetes.
✅ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform – Automate and manage cloud infrastructure effortlessly.
