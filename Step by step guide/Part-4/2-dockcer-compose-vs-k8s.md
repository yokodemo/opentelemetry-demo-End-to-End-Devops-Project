# Docker Compose vs Kubernetes

### Docker Compose

### Management of Multi-Container Applications 
- **Docker Compose** is ideal for **simple, single-host applications**.  
- It allows you to define and run multi-container applications with a single `docker-compose.yml` file.  
- **Docker Compose** is **best suited for development environments** and smaller-scale use cases.  

### Kubernetes

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes** is designed for **complex, multi-host environments** and large-scale applications.  
- It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containers across a **cluster of machines**.
